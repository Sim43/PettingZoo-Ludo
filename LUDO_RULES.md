## Ludo Rules (short)

- **Players and pieces**
  - 2–4 players, each with 4 pieces starting in their own yard.
  - In teams mode, players are grouped into fixed 2v2 teams by colour.

- **Dice and movement**
  - Players roll a single six-sided die on their turn.
  - A piece leaves the yard only on a roll of 6 and enters the main track at that colour’s start square.
  - Pieces move clockwise around a shared main track according to the die roll.
  - After travelling around the board, pieces move into a colour-specific home track and then into the final home position.

- **Safe squares, blocks, and captures**
  - Some squares are safe: pieces on safe squares cannot be captured and different colours may stack there freely.
  - On non-safe squares, two or more pieces of the same colour (or same team in teams mode) form a block that cannot be captured and that other pieces cannot pass through.
  - On a non-safe, non-blocked square, landing on exactly one enemy piece captures it and sends it back to its yard.

- **Capture requirement for home**
  - Each colour must capture at least one enemy piece before any of its pieces may enter the home track.
  - Before this first capture, moves that would normally enter home instead continue around the main track.

- **Extra turns and three-sixes rule**
  - A player gets an extra turn when they roll a 6, capture an enemy piece, or finish a piece.
  - Rolling three 6s in a row causes that player’s turn to be skipped and play passes to the next player.

- **Win conditions**
  - single: players are ranked by the order in which all four of their pieces reach the final home position.
  - Teams: a team wins when all pieces of both teammates reach the final home position; the other team loses.
